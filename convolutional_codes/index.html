        <h1>Convolutional Codes</h1>
        <p class="tld">In this document, I will attempt to visually explain the 
        encoding and decoding of convolutional codes, along with how their 
        properties tend to relate to their design.</p>

        <div class="content">

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="text_block">
                <em>Convolutional codes</em> were introduced in 1955 by Peter 
                Elias, and have become widely used in wireless communication.
                Despite the fact that they are rapidly losing ground to the
                more recently proposed <em>turbo codes</em>, they remain an
                interesting topic to study due to their intuitive nature and
                historical importance.
            </p>
            <p class="text_block">
                Convolutional codes differ from codes that we studied in class
                in that they send <em>only</em> the parity bits, where codes 
                like the Hamming 7,4 had data bits interspersed. Convolutional
                codes are defined by three things: a 
                <em>constraint length</em>, 
                <img src="math/yd9hlhrj.png" />, 
                an <em>inverse rate</em>, 
                <img src="math/375ggas.png" />, 
                and a collection of 
                <img src="math/375ggas.png" />
                polynomials, 
                <img src="math/yc2k3dnz.png" 
                style="vertical-align: middle;"/>.
            </p>

            <h2>Encoding</h2>
            <p class="text_block">
                Essentially, the parity bits are encoded by each of the 
                polynomials acting on a <em>sliding window</em> of 
                <img src="math/yd9hlhrj.png" />, 
                bits,
                moving along the stream of data until all of the data 
                has been processed. This is illustrated below.
            </p>

                In the above example, our constraint length,
                <img src="math/yd9hlhrj.png" />,
                is 5 and we are encoding with two polynomials:<br>
                <img src="math/y8e4ugzy.png" />, and
                <img src="math/ydb4no88.png" /> <br>
                Where 
                <img src="math/y9den4m6.png" style="vertical-align: bottom;" />
                denotes
                <img src="math/5ldlsl.png" />
                bit positions before the position of the right end of the 
                slider,
                <img src="math/y8pkcxg2.png" />.
                We start with 
                four padding bits shown with grey borders. This 
                ensures that the first collection of encoded bits are <em>
                transitioning</em> from the state 00. We will see later how 
                this helps with decoding. With two polynomials, we would expect
                our rate to be 1/2. and indeed the 15 data bits in the example
                are encoded as a 30 bit message.
            </p>

            <p class="text_block">
                Generally speaking, the longer the constraint length (sometimes 
                called the window size), the more resilient the code is to 
                bit errors, but also the longer it will take to decode. 
                Similarly, the larger the inverse rate, the more resilient the 
                code will be to bit errors, but also the less efficient the 
                coding will be. These are tradeoffs that need to be balanced 
                based on the specific application. 
            </p>

            <p class="text_block">
                In the demo below, play around with adjusting the inverse rate, 
                constraint length, and error probability, and observe how the 
                decoding time and resiliency react.

                I urge you not to take the absolute speeds too seriously. My 
                <a href="convolutional_codes.js">javascript implementation</a>
                of the Viterbi algorithm (to be discussed) 
                leaves a lot to be desired in terms of runtime optimization. 
                The point was rather to convey some intuition about the

                When constructing a convolutional code, the polynomials 
                themselves, not just the number of them, is highly influential
                to the overall quality of the code. Given a constraint length 
                of 5 and an inverse rate of 3, experiment with different 
                polynomial coefficents and observe the resulting rates.
                What happens when two polynomials are the same? What about 
                when one of the polynomials is all zero? Why? (You can flip 
                coefficient bits by clicking on them)

                As you can see, clearly the choice for polynomials has a 
                significant effect on error correction, but how do we choose
                good polynomials? Selecting polynomials is outside the scope of
                our discussion, but a good reference on the subject can be 
                found <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40314-014-0202-3">here</a>.

                There are two prevailing ways to visualize convolutional codes:
                the first is as a <em>block diagram</em>, where one wires 
                together the various "registers" involved with computing each
                parity bit. The second is as a <em>state machine</em>, where 
                one imagines the encoder as a set of states with well-defined 
                transitions between them, depending on the data that is 
                encountered. An animation of each of these is shown below. 
            </p>

            <h3>Visualizing the Encoding Process</h3>

            <p class="text_block">
                Both are valid interpretations of the encoding process, but 
                state machines are a particularly useful construct when 
                learning about the <em>decoding</em> process, which we discuss 
                next.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Decoding</h2>
            <p class="text_block">
                To decode a convolutional code is to determine which sequence
                of data bits were <em>most likely</em> sent given the parity 
                bits that were received. If our problem has a symmetric bit 
                error probability 
                <img src="math/yaeksruq.png" 
                style="vertical-align: middle;" />,
                then this amounts to finding the data string whose correct 
                parity bits have the smallest Hamming distance from the bits 
                that were received.
            </p>

            <p class="text_block">
                One possible approach to this is brute force: simply enumerate
                all possible data strings, compute their parity bits, and 
                select the closest one to what you received. Unfortunately, 
                the computational complexity of this is 
                <img src="math/yahnwuhq.png" 
                style="vertical-align: middle;" />,
                meaning that even for small packets of information, it will be
                <b>far</b> too slow.

            <p class="text_block">
                The algorithm used for efficiently decoding convolutional codes
                was invented by Andrew Viterbi in 1967, although it has been 
                independently discovered at least 7 different times. Its key 
                insight is to aggregate the errors that would have had to occur
                incrementally while receiving the messages, and discard series
                as soon as it's clear that they are not the minimum distance. 
            </p>
    
            <p class="text_block">
                The data structure used to formalize the decoding problem is 
                called a <em>trellis</em>, which is a special type of graph 
                that arises from state machines. It consists of a collection of 
                nodes for each time step, each with directed edges only to 
                those nodes at the next time step for which they have a 
                possible transition to.
            </p>

            <p class="text_block">
                The illustration below is a subgraph of the trellis. The solid 
                edges represent the true state changes, and the dotted edges 
                represent the other state change that was possible if a 
                different bit was encountered by the sliding window at that 
                step. The red corresponds to the parity bits that the encoding
                system "emits" when encoding the data.
            </p>
    

            <h3>Trellis Generation</h3>
            <div class="playground">
                <img src="trellis.png" height=260 />
            </div>

            <p class="text_block">
                Given a received message with errors, the algorithm works by 
                assigning to each state in the next step of the trellis a cost,
                found by summing the minimum cost to the previous state plus 
                the cost of the transition (the Hamming distance between what
                was emitted and what was observed). If there are two paths to a
                particular state, discard the most costly one. This is 
                continued until the end of the received message, and the path 
                to the final state with the least cost is selected. An 
                illustration of this is shown below.

            <p class="text_block">
                The Viterbi algorithm occupies an important place in signal 
                processing, not just because of its use to decode convolutional
                codes, but also because it can be used to find 
                maximum-likelihood paths in all sorts of finite state models 
                (e.g. Hidden Markov Models, or soft convolutional codes).

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="text_block">
                This concludes our discussion of encoding and decoding 
                convolutional codes. As I mentioned in my introduction, turbo
                codes have started to overtake convolutional codes in everyday
                use, but convolutional codes occupy and important part of the 
                history of error correcting codes, and they serve as an 
                educational example regarding the importance of fast algorithms
                to effective technology. Without them, digital communication as 
                we know it would not be possible.
